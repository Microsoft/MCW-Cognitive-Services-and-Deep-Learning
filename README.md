# Cognitive services and deep learning

In this workshop, you will help Contoso Ltd. build a proof of concept that shows how they can build a solution that amplifies the claims processing capabilities of their agents.

They would like to start by automatically classifying each claim detail a customer types in as either home or auto based on the text. This classification would be displayed in the claim summary, so an agent can quickly assess whether they are dealing with purely a home claim, an auto claim or a claim that has a mixture of the two.

They would also like to experiment applying sentiment analysis to the claim text. They know most customers are either factual in their description (a neutral sentiment) or slightly unhappy (a more negative sentiment), but believe that a negative sentiment can be an indicator to claim text that involves a more severe situation, which might warrant an expedited review by an agent.

Next, they would like to automatically summarize long claim text. This summarization would enable the agent to get the gist before having to read the full claim and can quickly remind themselves of the claim when revisiting it.

Finally, they would like to automatically extract information from the photos submitted with the claims to increase their searchability.

## Abstracts

### Workshop

In this workshop, you will learn to combine both pre-built artificial intelligence (AI) in the form of various Cognitive Services, with custom AI in the form of services built and deployed with Azure Machine Learning service. You will learn to create intelligent solutions atop unstructured text data by designing and implementing a text analytics pipeline. You will also learn how to build a binary classifier using a simple neural network that can be used to classify the textual data. Also, you will learn how to deploy multiple kinds of predictive services using Azure Machine Learning and learn to integrate with the Computer Vision API and the Text Analytics API from Cognitive Services.

At the end of this workshop, you will be better able to present solutions leveraging Azure Machine Learning service, Azure Databricks and Cognitive Services.

### Whiteboard design session

In this whiteboard design session, you will work with a group to design a solution which combines both pre-built artificial intelligence (AI) in the form of various Cognitive Services, with custom AI in the form of services built and deployed with Azure Machine Learning services. You will learn to create intelligent solutions atop unstructured text data by designing and implementing a text analytics pipeline. You will discover how to build a binary classifier using a simple neural network that can be used to classify the textual data, as well as how to deploy multiple kinds of predictive services using Azure Machine Learning and learn to integrate with the Computer Vision API and the Text Analytics API from Cognitive Services.

At the end of this whiteboard design session, you will be better able to design solutions leveraging Azure Machine Learning services and Cognitive Services.

### Hands-on lab

In this hands-on lab, you will implement a solution which combines both pre-built artificial intelligence (AI) in the form of various Cognitive Services, with custom AI in the form of services built and deployed with Azure Machine Learning services. You will learn to create intelligent solutions atop unstructured text data by designing and implementing a text analytics pipeline. You will discover how to build a binary classifier using a simple neural network that can be used to classify the textual data, as well as how to deploy multiple kinds of predictive services using Azure Machine Learning and learn to integrate with the Computer Vision API and the Text Analytics API from Cognitive Services.
